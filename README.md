# SBA Design and Development

The main challenge I faced was trying to get the last tile to work with bootstraps grid system. Because of how much content the tile had, it made it very difficult to align it with the other tiles utilizing bootstraps utility classes. I tried moving different columns into different rows, played with padding, limiting container heights and width's, I just could not get it. It was actually a decent lesson in knowing when you are beaten. 

So I tried working with getting the layout first, putting the tiles in the right spots. THen i tried styling the boxes, proper background colors and box shadows. Then once the tiles were prepped, I put the contents of each tile in, and everything was going so well till that last tile. 

If i had more time, I'd probably try using masonry.js to see if i can get the right touches. Karl suggested it in class, but too be honest, I needed this SBA to really deepen my understanding of Bootstrap, and I don't think it was realistic to try and throw something else I don't know on top and try and make the two work in tandem. I'm still a young grashopper. Gotta walk before I can run.
